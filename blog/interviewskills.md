## What are interviews?
The first step in preparing for an interview is to understand the different types of interviews. The major distinction in types of interviews between unstructured and structured interviews. Unstructured interviews are when interviewers do not prepare uniform questions to ask each applicant. It's not likely you will have an unstructured interview as any decent organization hiring an I-O should use a structured format. You may not get to know in advance what type of structured interview you will be conducting, so it's helpful to be prepared for any type.

There are many structured interview formats, but you will most likely encounter one of the following:
- **Situational interviews** ask candidates how they would respond to [hypothetical workplace situations](https://www.coursera.org/articles/situational-interview-questions). These are very common interviews and [offer the best validity](https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.79.4.599). Good situational interviews will also provide you with a realistic job preview as they are typically developed by the hiring manager representing the real-world day-to-day issues faced in the role. If time allows, you may want to ask follow-ups about this explicitly by asking how often this type of situation comes up in the role. 
- **Behavioral interviews** ask candidates to [describe situations in the past ](https://www.coursera.org/articles/behavioral-interview-questions)) and how they were handled rather than providing a hypothetical scenario from the interviewer. A common question in behavioral interviews is "tell me about a time you had a disagreement with a coworker" or some variant. In any case it never hurts to ask follow-ups here as well. Behavioral interviews are less valid than situational interviews but still much more valid than unstructured interviews.
- **Job talks** are when candidates give a formal presentation on some topic, typically for I-Os you will give a presentation on your research. These are a lot more common for academic jobs, but job talks are used in industry as well, typically with a structured interview to follow. This is obviously a demonstration test of your presentation skills [so practice in advance](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2018/01/10/advice-giving-effective-job-presentation-opinion)). It's polite to ask if your audience would prefer to ask questions during or at the end of the talk.
- **Informal interviews** usually ask the candidate to discuss the role outside of the typical interview setting, such as over coffee or a meal. This is probably more an unstructured interview, but typically the interviewer is more likely making an assessment about your fit with the team or organization or trying to assess your personality. Although the setting may be informal understand you are still very much being evaluated so give it your best and keep in mind [the shopping cart theory](https://twitter.com/jothornely/status/1259721946830274560))
- **Panel interviews** leverage multiple interviewers for one interviewee instead of just one interviewer. These are very common. The panel may rotate through asking you questions or just the hiring manager may ask you questions. In these interviews the panel will likely introduce themselves and how they are related to the role. Panel interviews may include people from another team in the organization to get an outsiders perspective.
## What are the goals of the interview?
The primary goal of the interview is to confidently demonstrate your competence for the role. Regardless of the interview type, even if you get unorthodox questions, answer the question fully and steer it into a conversation where you are demonstrating some key knowledge, skill, or ability to perform the role or past behavior where you demonstrated competence in a similar situation. The panel will want you to demonstrate how you will contribute to the team.

A close secondary goal of the interview is to demonstrate your fit with the individuals on the team and the organization. It should be obvious you share the same values and interests of the team through your interactions and answers to the interviewers questions. You were attracted to the organization enough to interview, so also use this as your opportunity to evaluate the organizations fit with your personality, values, and interests.

It's important to keep competence as the primary goal. You may well know other members of the team or the main interviewer, but recognize this meeting is for a specific purpose. Don't get too personal, but don't be cold either. Keeping your personal information to yourself can also help protect you from bad actors. They exist in every organization, and you never know what could be used as a cudgel against you in the future. This also helps set a precedent for good boundary management to prevent work family conflict as well.
## How can I interview well?
The interview begins long before you step in front of the panel. A successful interview is 90% preparation and 10% perspiration, so think of the behaviors you should engage in before, during, and after the interview:

*Before the interview*
- [ ] **Know your rights** and [illegal interview questions](https://ocs.yale.edu/channels/illegal-interview-questions/)
- [ ] **Practice interviewing** with a current hiring manager in your field
- [ ] **Research** the organization, position, and hiring manager and prepare specific questions
- [ ] **Clarify the interview details** including date, time, and location using closed loop communication
- [ ] **Know your audience**, are you talking to an HR representative, a recruiter, or your future manager  

*During the interview*
- [ ] **Arrive early** to the interview
- [ ] **Demonstrate your competence** in responding to each question
- [ ] **Avoid sharing too much personal information** but be warm and collegial
- [ ] **Clearly and concisely answer** each question in totality
- [ ] [**Use the STAR method**](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/situational-interview-questions-and-answers) to organize your responses 

*After the interview*
- [ ] **Ask about next steps** and when you can expect to hear back
- [ ] **Write down details** you want to remember
- [ ] **Send a thank you** email to the interviewers
- [ ] **Follow-up** if you don't hear back
- [ ] **Wait to negotiate compensation** until you've been extended an offer
## What are some example situational interview questions?
Below are a few example situational interview questions for I-Os in industry. In my examples, I am using a behaviorally anchored rating scale (BARS) like the ones we use for performance appraisal in organizations. An [example from ETS](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ets2.12152) covers example questions for a variety of competencies including communication, leadership, persuasion and negotation, and teamwork skills with multiple questions per competency.
### Example 1: Client Management
*Suppose your client asks for preliminary data or results which have not yet been quality control checked, how would you respond?*

**Below expectations:**
- Tells the client 'no' without explanation
- Delivers preliminary dataset with no caveats

**Meets expectations:**
- Works with client to delay delivery of dataset
- Delivers preliminary dataset with caveats

**Above Expectations:**
- Works with client to discover why they want the preliminary data and answer client's question another way
- Discusses other options with client such as previous datasets and attempts to steer towards other options
### Example 2: Communication Skills
*While briefing the results of a cognitive ability test developed for a client, a key stakeholder expresses skepticism about standardized testing, generally, citing examples of colleges and universities removing tests like the SAT as admissions requirements. How would you respond?*

**Below expectations:**
- Undermines the test or brief by validating the skepticism
- Forcefully rebuffs or overcorrects the client

**Meets expectations:**
- Acknowledges the clients concerns
- Gently discusses current validation evidence and external validity evidence (e.g., cites literature)

**Above Expectations:**
- Acknowledge clients concerns and asks probative questions to understand the root of this skepticism (e.g., popular press headlines)
- Gently discusses validation evidence, theoretical and empirical underpinnings, specific contradictory examples or storytelling
### Example 3: Leadership
*You are leading two of your peers on a project, but one is not meeting their deadlines. How would you take corrective action?*

**Below expectations:**
- Tells the peer to pull their weight without surfacing the reason why they're falling behind
- Takes on the peers division of labor without solving the performance issue

**Meets expectations:**
- Works with the peer to ensure they meet their deadlines
- Elevates the issue if the peer does not take corrective action

**Above Expectations:**
- Takes time to surface the reasons for the performance issue and expresses their perceptions in "I" language (e.g, I see/feel)
- Allows time for the peer to take corrective action individually elevates as needed.

## Are you available to coach me?
If you are an I-O graduate student preparing for the job market and would like to do a one hour interview coaching session I would be happy to do so for free. One caveat is that I will not work with students from predatory online I-O programs as they do not adequately prepare students for the requirements of an I-O job and I will not compensate on their behalf. I'd be happy to use that time, instead, to help you find worthwhile programs.

In the case you are applying for a specific job, please come prepared with the job description and be prepared to talk about your skillset, any research you've conducted, and any teaching or industry experience.
